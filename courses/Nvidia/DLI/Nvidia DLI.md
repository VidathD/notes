## Data Science Overview

### The Full 5-Level Analytics Framework

1. **Descriptive Analytics** – _What happened?_  
    → Summarizes past data (reports, dashboards)
2. **Diagnostic Analytics** – _Why did it happen?_  
    → Root cause analysis, drill-downs
3. **Predictive Analytics** – _What will happen?_  
    → Uses ML/statistics to forecast future outcomes
4. **Prescriptive Analytics** – _What should we do about it?_  
    → Recommends actions using optimization & simulations
5. **Cognitive (or Augmented) Analytics** – **The new 5th one**  
    → _What can the system learn and decide on its own?_
