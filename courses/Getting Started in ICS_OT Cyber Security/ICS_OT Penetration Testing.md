## Reconnaissance

[ICSRank](https://icsrank.com) provides a GUI where you can select a device you want to search for, and it will create a [Shodan](https://shodan.io) query and search it.

[SNMP](../../network/communication%20protocol/TCP%20IP%20layer%204/OSI%20layer%207/SNMP.md) is often useful, as most ICS systems will just disclose information when queried with SNMP. [snmpwalk](../../tools/hacking/network/protocol%20specific/SNMP/snmpwalk.md) can be used for this.
