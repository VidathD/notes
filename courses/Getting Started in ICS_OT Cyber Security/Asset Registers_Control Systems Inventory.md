## The Important Role of Asset Registers

This is an inventory of all hardware and software within an environment. It needs to include **all** assets, including hardware, software, and firmware assets. This also includes virtualized assets.

An asset register is never going to be perfect, as the assets can always change. 
- A maintenance technician can connect a new field device.
- A PLC programmer connects a new EWS to the network.
- Someone can plug in a USB drive.
- A bored team member in the control room can plug in an Xbox. 
- An attacker can plant a device.

We cannot protect what we don't know we have. So it is important to have an asset register that is as accurate as possible. This provides a strong foundation for threat and vulnerability management.

If an attacker gains access to an asset register, they will have a map of the environment and will be able to plan future attacks more easily.

## Creating an Asset Register

The most common asset register tool is Excel. Other database software and COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) solutions also exist. When using cloud based applications, risk of it falling onto attackers hands should be considered.
