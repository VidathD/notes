Inflation is a continuous increase in price of goods and services for two consecutive quarters.

Hyperinflation is defined as an economic phenomenon where due to rapid inflation, the currency becomes virtually worthless.

Inflation is most damaging to fixed-rate debt securities, like FD and T-bills, as it devalues both interest and principal payments. If inflation rate exceeds interest rate, you are at a loss. Longer term securities are more vulnerable.

This is why, investors sometimes focus on *real interest rate* obtained by subtracting *rate of inflation* from *nominal interest rate.*

1. Ensure that your investment portfolio contains assets that will retain their value during a period of hyperinflation. However, inflation adjusted price may not be high as appraised price prior to inflation.
    - Real estate
    - Gold, silver
    - Oil
    - Commodities
2. To hedge against hyperinflation in home currency, diversify into other strong currencies. 
    - US Dollar
    - Euro
    - Japanese Yen
    - British Pound
3. Take advice of an investment advisor who specializes in complex asset classes like foreign currency, stocks, gold, minerals and rare gems. While these usually retain their value, they come with a risk because of investor ignorance and limited liquidity.

### Investing in Real Estate

When considering investments like real estate, you will gain by both capital gain and rent income. With inflation, you can also raise the rent.

Investors can buy real estate directly or invest in it by buying shares of a *real estate investment trust (REIT)* or specialized fund.

### Investing in Gold

Gold can also be purchased directly as a bullion from dealer (typically recognized jewellery shops) or indirectly by investing in a mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF) that owns gold. You can also buy shares of the producer directly. 

## Types of Inflation

### Demand-Pull inflation

When the demand for some product or service is high, and the supply can't keep up, the price increases. 

### Cost-Push Inflation

Since the cost of production or providing a service increases, the price of that good or service also increases. This can be because of taxes as well. For example, a high VAT increases the price of goods and services.
