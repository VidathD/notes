## What is Stock Market and Shares?

A collection of markets and exchanges where shares of publicly-held companies are bought, sold and issued. 

A business usually goes from,
- Sole proprietorship ⇾ partnership ⇾ private limited company ⇾ public limited company

Shares represent equity ownership in a cooperation or a financial asset that investors obtain in exchange for capital. 

Shares usually enable voting rights and possible returns through price appreciation and dividends. 

Most companies have shares but only shares of publicly-traded companies are found on the stock market.


## Intelligent Investor Book by Benjamin Graham

In this book, there is a fundamental distinction between *investment* and *speculation.* Typically, it is recommended to have 80% investments and 20% speculations in your portfolio.

**No. 1 Rule of Investing:** Never lose money. (Know the risks.)

- Invest $(100-\text{Your Age})\%$ of your income in stocks. Invest 80% in strong fundamental stocks and 20% in trading (If you really want to).
- Don't buy a stock just because you like the product. Do an analysis of financial statements to protect yourself from risky investments.
- Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed, with a long record of continuous dividend payment.
- Use your understanding of certain industries when investing to “outperform the experts.”
- Finding a promising company is only the 1st step. Then you have to do the research.
- Investing in “what you know” can be a weakness because you are less likely to search for weaknesses.
- Never buy a stock immediately after a substantial rise or sell after a substantial drop.
- You can't control the performance in short term, but can control brokerage costs, ownership costs, expectations, risks, tax, and your behaviour.
- Investing isn't about beating others. It's about controlling yourself.
- Luck is more important than skill.
- Look at past performance. However, this is only a pale indication. 
    - Usually losers of the past are almost never the winners of the future. Especially if annual expenditure is above average.
- The chance to buy may come only once 3 or 5 years. Make use of it.

## The Two Types of Return in Stock Market

### Capital Gain

The gap between the amount a stock is bought for and sold for, if it is a profit is capital gain.

### Dividend Payment

Stable companies pay a part of their profit to the shareholders. This is dividend payment.

$$
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual dividends per share}}{\text{Current share price}} \times 100\%
$$

## How to Select the Best Stocks to Invest

Look at,
1. Net Assets Per Share/Net Asset Value (NAV)
2. Price/Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
3. Dividend Yield

If possible, also consider other investor ratios.
- Profit Margins
- Earnings Per Share (EPS)
- Price to Book Value (PBV) - Buy if <1
- Gearing Ratio
- Return on Equity
- Dividend Yield

### Net Assets Per Share(NAPS)/Net Asset Value (NAV)

$$\text{Net Asset Value}=\frac{\text{Fund Assets}-\text{Fund Liabilities}}{\text{Total number of outstanding shares}}$$

- Buy stocks below NAV (Undervalued).


### P/E Ratio

$$\text{P/E Ratio}=\frac{\text{Market Share Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}$$

Invest in companies with a P/E ratio below the market P/E and sector P/E.

A high P/E ratio indicates that it is overvalued or that high growth is expected.

**Companies that are losing money or have no earnings don't have a P/E ratio since there is nothing to put to the denominator.**


### Earnings per Share (EPS)

$$\text{EPS}=\frac{\text{Total Earnings}}{\text{Number of Shares}}$$

Higher, the better.


## Sectors in CSE

There are 20 main sectors in the CSE. It is recommended to diversify the sectors when investing.

2. Behaviour of monsoons and performance of agriculture.
3. Trends in public investments and savings
4. Monetary and fiscal (government revenue/tax) policy.
