- All investments have risks and benefits.

## Understanding Wealth

- The monetary value of assets we own is the wealth. Add up all we own and subtract all we owe.
- Own - Owe = Wealth


## Risk Management

Everyone has different risk tolerances and all investments carry risks. Be comfortable with your investments. 

Generally, greater the risk, greater the return. This is to compensate for the uncertainty.

The risk appetite can depend on, 
- Financial goals
- Time horizon
- Financial risk tolerance

2. Risk of Capital Loss (Value going down)
3. Risk of Inflation (Value of money go down)
4. Risk of Liquidity (Can't take the money out quickly)


## Money Vs Debit vs Credit card

Credit cards represent a loan. The card is just a way to access a line of credit.

Debit card is a way to spend checkable deposits (money you already have), just like a paper check.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit Cards

**Advantages:**
- Pre-approved loan
- Widely accepted
- Some consumer protection
- Can establish credit history

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires discipline from borrower
- Can have high fees and interest
- Identity theft

Usually it is a good decision to take credit for,

- Transport
- Necessities

This is because credit allows you to access a service or product immediately rather than saving up in the future.
