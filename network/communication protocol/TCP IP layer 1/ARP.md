Address Resolution Protocol or ARP is used to associate logical [IP addresses](../TCP%20IP%20layer%202/OSI%20layer%203/IP/IP%20address.md) to physical [MAC addresses](../../MAC%20address.md).

ARP is based on broadcast traffic which is sent to all listening systems on the network. Broadcast traffic is blocked by routers by default, limiting ARP's visibility.
