# Data Link Layer

> Vidath Dissanayake | Sri Lanka
> Links: [OSI Model](../OSI%20Model/OSI%20Model.md)

This layer makes decisions on an Ethernet [network](../../../network.md) based on [MAC addresses](../../../MAC%20address.md). Devices such as Ethernet switches belong to this layer.

The [NIC](../../devices/layer%202/NIC.md) is the physical device that enables this layer, along with the Logical Link Control (LLC) which is the driver for the NIC. LLC can be considered as the upper sub-layer of Data Link layer.
