After [sniffing](sniffing.md) and capturing the packets, it is important to analyse those packets.

Packet Analysis is the process of capturing, dissecting and reviewing network data. This allows to,
- Establish healthy network baseline.
- Determine active network assets.
- Continuous monitoring of network performance.
    - Bandwidth utilization, protocols used, top talkers, most used applications

Essentially it allows visibility into what is happening in a network. This can be used both offensively and defensively. 

Defenders can discover active systems and network vulnerabilities for remediation. They can also look for suspicious activity indicating a security incident.
